## 🧠 Problem Statement

> How can we increase first-time mutual fund investment rates for users under 30 — without losing trust or financial literacy?

Young Indians find traditional investing platforms (Groww, INDmoney) confusing and intimidating due to jargon, lack of motivation, and no visible progress. Our goal was to create a habit-forming, gamified investing experience — tailored for Gen Z — that simplifies decisions and builds confidence.
